In order to start programming the microcontroller, the user has to install Code Composer Studio (C\+CS) from TI. In C\+CS, the T\+I\+V\+Aware library has to be installed. This can be done through the Resource Explorer avaliable in C\+CS. The Resource Explorer can be reached from Help $>$ Getting Started $>$ Browse Examples.

 Once the libraries have been installed, create a new project

 Ensure that the Tiva T\+M4\+C1294\+N\+C\+P\+DT chip is selected and give your project a name. When you are done, select Finish

 The code perspective will open up. On the left the active project is bolded. Your new project should be bolded. If it is not, select it. Some libraries have to be manually added to the project before the code can run. Right click the project name in Project Explorer, and select properties.

Under C\+CS Build $>$ A\+RM Compiler $>$ Include options, include the Tivaware library.

 Next, under C\+CS Build $>$ A\+RM Linker $>$ File Search Path the library files for the driver library are included. The sensorlib files are also included in the same manner

 Finally the files from the Github project can be added to the project. Because version control is already managed by Github in this case, the files are linked into the the project. However, the user can also add the files directly into the project.

 If the files cannot be added, delete the conflicting file in the project and attempt to add the file again. Once all the files have been added, C\+CS should look like the following state.

 The code is built by clicking on the hammer icon. In order to program the board, the green debug symbol is clicked. Test by compiling the code. It should compile without any errors.

\hypertarget{index_writingcustomcode}{}\section{Writing Custom Code}\label{index_writingcustomcode}
Two timers (Timer 6 and Timer 7) are set up in the code and can execute at user-\/set frequencies in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}}}. The intention is that the user will either write code in \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}} or create a header and source file. Here, an simple example will be set out to compute simple position control over motor 1 in \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}} at 5k\+Hz.\hypertarget{index_writinginterrupts}{}\subsection{Writing Interrupts}\label{index_writinginterrupts}
In Code Composer Studio, Interrupts follow a general format. There is the interrupt initialization, the interrupt function itself, and a declaration of the interrupt function in the interrupt vector table in {\ttfamily tm4c1294ncpdt\+\_\+startup\+\_\+ccs.\+c}.

In this example the timer interrupt has already been declared under {\ttfamily custom\+Timers\+Init()} and the corresponding timer functions have been declared in {\ttfamily tm4c1294ncpdt\+\_\+startup\+\_\+ccs.\+c}.

In {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}}}, update frequency\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    #define TIMER_6_FREQUENCY 5000
\end{DoxyVerb}


Add global variables for the P\+ID controller in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}}} \begin{DoxyVerb}int int_error = 0;
int prev_error = 0;
\end{DoxyVerb}


Under {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c_a57b21594b75d4b2a140a1f9bbb1465e8}{T\+I\+M\+E\+R6\+Int\+Handler()}}} in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}void TIMER6IntHandler(){
    float kp = 0.5;
    float ki = 1;
    float kd = 0;
    desired_position = 60; //degrees
    encoderRead(); // update the encoder
    int actual = readMotor1RawRelative(); // read counts set to relative
    int raw = readMotor1Raw(); // read counts absolute
    int error = angles2Counts(desired_position) - actual;
    int u = kp*error+kd*prev_error+ki*int_error;
     int_error = int_error+error;
     prev_error = error;
    motor1ControlPWM(u);
 }  
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{index_communication}{}\subsection{U\+A\+R\+T communication}\label{index_communication}
In order to communicate over U\+A\+RT, several functions are provided under {\ttfamily system\+Init()}. In the default case, the U\+A\+RT is already initialised to a baud rate of 115200, 8\+N1 mode. This example will use a polling method to process input from the user.

First set up a global variable in {\ttfamily main.\+c} that will be used to store the desired angle\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}volatile int setAngle = 0;
\end{DoxyVerb}


In {\ttfamily main.\+c}, under {\ttfamily main()}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    int main(void){
    char buffer[50]; // set up a char buffer

    while(1){ // set up an infinite loop

        UART0read(buffer); // read the buffer
        scanf("%d",setAngle); 
        sprintf(buffer,"Okay! Setting to: %d",setAngle) // acknowledge
        UART0write(buffer,50); // write to the buffer

    }   
}
\end{DoxyVerb}


Add a global variable in {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c}{r2r.\+c}}} to refer to the set\+Angle variable we just created in main.\+c\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}    extern int setAngle;
\end{DoxyVerb}


Now we have to modify the code in the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{r2r_8c_a57b21594b75d4b2a140a1f9bbb1465e8}{T\+I\+M\+E\+R6\+Int\+Handler()}}} to refer to this variable\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}void TIMER6IntHandler(){
    float kp = 0.5;
    float ki = 1;
    float kd = 0;
    desired_position = setAngle; //degrees
    encoderRead(); // update the encoder
    int actual = readMotor1RawRelative(); // read counts set to relative
    int raw = readMotor1Raw(); // read counts absolute
    int error = angles2Counts(desired_position) - actual;
    int u = kp*error+kd*prev_error+ki*int_error;
     int_error = int_error+error;
     prev_error = error;
    motor1ControlPWM(u);
 }  
\end{DoxyVerb}

The M\+A\+T\+L\+AB menu can also be modified to fit a custom control law.
